**Assignment 1 - HTML and CSS Drawing - Remixed**

***remixed project in the assignment 1 branch***

[Joshua's Original Project](https://github.com/yankeejoshy/webDrawing/tree/assignment1)

- First I changed the music playing in the background for a hypnotizing effect
- I expanded the main video to take up a larger portion of the page
- If the user hovers over the main gif frame, it begins to rotate
- The sidebar now features only the previews of the cat videos and no filter selections
- When user hovers over the sidebar images, the images turn into a gif
- When the sidebar images are pressed, the filter is randomly applied and the gif shifts into the main frame.
