**Assignment 1 - HTML and CSS Drawing**

First I changed the music playing in the background and expanded the main video to take up a larger portion of the page.
The sidebar now features only the previews of the cat videos and no filter selections.
Instead, when the sidebar images are pressed, the filter is randomly applied and the gif moves into the main frame.
When user hovers over the sidebar images, the images turn into a gif.
If the user hovers over the main gif frame, it begins to rotate.
